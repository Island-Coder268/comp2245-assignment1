      <p>
        For the most part I am a quiet, down to earth, funny, easy going guy. I
        come from a tight knit family with strong values. I enjoy a constructive
        conversation, hanging out with friends, playing sports, and having a
        good laugh. My career is in Information Technology. I like to constantly
        try to improve myself & work towards new goals. I don't give up so easy
        sometimes my persistence does become annoying. My motivation is my
        mother as I love her a lot. I'm an introvert. I don't like crowds and I
        recharge best alone. I enjoy spending the day with the family, taking a
        vacation, enjoying a hobby, playing sports, reading a book, catching up
        on SportsCenter news, and binge-watching Netflix. I'm passionate about
        web development because itnallows me to blend creativity and
        problem-solving skills, as I can transform my ideas into functional and
        visually appealing websites or web applications.
